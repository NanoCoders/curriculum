# Nanocoders Python Curriculum
Written by Gautam Mittal for 2016 Summer Session<br />
5 Day Curriculum -
Assumes proficiency with basic programming in Scratch or some equivalent<br /><br />
Source code for the curriculum: [https://github.com/gmittal](https://github.com/gmittal)

#### Notes
- Need to figure out whether the project for the course should start on Day 1 and end on Day 5, or whether the first three days should have mini learning projects and the last two days have one huge projects
- TODO: Need to post source code files on GitHub
- Most of the daily agendas and objectives will probably need to be refactored (they are not final)

----

### Day 1: Basics
Lesson:
- Understand fundamentals of the environment
- Basic mathematical and string operations in Python
- Create a basic calculator program

Goals:
- Apply understanding of Scratch code blocks like conditionals, loops, and variables and apply them to very basic Python programming
- Students will become comfortable with text-based programming environment
- Apply basic knowledge by creating a very simple Python application
- Introduce NanoCoders Python Documentation (our handbook for Python which can be used as reference if students get stuck or forget syntax)


Concepts:
- Numerical and String Operations
- Modules
- Basic Scratch blocks translated to Python
- ***Project***: *Build a calculator(?) in Python (or some other super basic project)*

### Day 2: Data Structures
Objectives:
-
- ***Project***: *Build a calculator(?) in Python*
